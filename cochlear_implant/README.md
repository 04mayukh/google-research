# Cochlear Implant Hackathon Code

This directory contains Python Colab notebooks for taking input audio (wav files of music, speech in noise, etc.) and generating electrodograms for cochlear implants.

These were developed as a submission for [https://cihackathon.com/](https://cihackathon.com/).

To listen to the audio corresponding to the electrodograms, you will need to a vocoder simulation (e.g., the one provided by cihackathon organizers [here](https://github.com/jabeim/AB-Generic-Python-Toolbox)).

## Input data

To run the notebooks, you need:

1. A set of audio waveform files to process.

Sample audio files for cihackathon are available for at [https://cihackathon.com/](https://cihackathon.com/).


## Running the notebooks

At the moment these notebooks are for reference only and may not be runnable.
