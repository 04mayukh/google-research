Creating accurate machine learning models capable of localizing and identifying
multiple objects in a 3D scene and assigning semantic labels to the scene components is a core challenge in computer vision with applications in robotics and autonomous driving. The TensorFlow 3D codebase is an open source framework built on top of TensorFlow 2 and Keras that makes it easy to construct, train and deploy 3D Object Detection, 3D Semantic Segmentation and 3D Instance Segmentation models. At Google weâ€™ve certainly found this codebase to be useful for our computer vision needs, and we hope that you will as well.

Contributions to the codebase are welcome and we would love to hear back from
you if you find this codebase useful. Finally if you use the TensorFlow 3D for a research publication, please consider citing:

# Release Notes

This release includes:

* GPU/CPU op for 3d submanifold sparse convolution.
* A configurable 3d sparse voxel unet network that is used as the feature extractor in our models.
